<h1>Ordering notice</h1>

<p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>

<p>Thanks for placing an order from {{ company }}. It's scheduled to
    ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>

<p>Here are the items you've ordered:</p>

<ul>
    {% for item in item_list %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% if ordered_warranty %}
<p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
{% else %}
<p>You didn't order a warranty, so you're on your own when
    the products inevitably stop working.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>Sincerely,<br/>{{ company }}</p>
